I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria

* The user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down
* Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* The user can enter an event in a time block on click
* The text for that event is saved in local storage on click of the save button
* The saved events persist on page refresh
